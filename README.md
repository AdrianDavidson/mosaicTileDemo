This is a project demonstrating Front end manipulation, retriving data (images and its related information) via fetch api calls and displaying them in a 'mosaic' layour. when the user hovers over an image more information for that image is shown as well as an overlay.

there is a button which will generate more images within the page withut refreshing the page.

it is mobile responsive and will force all the images in a single line layout which is best suited to a mobile phone.
